## Project Overview

- This project is developed to demonstrate my expertise in frontend development, which is a simple blog with six posts. Users can login to access the posts section. After a successful login, users will be redirected to the posts page, where six blog posts will be fetched and displayed using `react-query`. Additionally, users can click on any post to view its details.

- After a successful login, a test token will be generated and stored in cookies.

- Without the token, users cannot access the blog posts or the post details pages.

-project is responsive on different devices with a moderate focus on ui using Tailwind CSS

-SEO bestpractices are also considered
